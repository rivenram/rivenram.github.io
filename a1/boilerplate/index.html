    <h4>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h4>
        <p>When I first accessed the website, I was surprised at how it takes a few minutes for the browser to fully load the website, which usually means that there are a lot of things on the website.</p>

    <h4>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h4>
        <p>
        - Moved my cursor around the page<br>
        - Noticed the windows on the background<br>
        - Modifies the mouse size/vibrato rate to see what changes it made<br>
        - Modifies the zoom/turbo<br>
        - Modifies the lookupRadius/delay feedback<br>
        - Resets the settings<br>
        - Modifies the normalsRatio/lowpass<br> 
        - Modifies the lightness/voices<br>
        - Modifies the gleams, entropy, and worm<br>
        - Resets the settings
        </p>

    <h4>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h4>
        <p>Dragging my mouse cursor around the screen as the liquid animation follows.</p>

    <h4>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h4>
        <p>Messing around with each setting.</p>

    <h4>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h4>
        <p>To show the website visitors that the potential of what you can create for a website is endless.</p>

    <h4>6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h4>
        <p>The constant animation that follows the mouse cursor and the variation of settings available proves that the potential to create something on a website is endless.</p>

    <h4>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h4>
        <p>By trying different setting combinations and analyzing how it affects the animation.</p>

    <h4>8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h4>
        <p>Users may try different setting combinations until they found the combination that they like.</p>
    
    <h4>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h4>
        <p>Audio-Visual Synthesis.</p>
        
    <h4>10. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h4>
        <p>It suggests the users to interact with the liquid animation with the sounds on, as the sound will interact and adapts with the Liquid interaction and vice versa.</p>
        
    <h4>11. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h4>
        <p>Curious and amazed. <br>
        Curious as the users' experiments and play around with the settings, trying out different settings combinations to see how and what changes it made. <br>
        Amazed as the interaction on the website proves the capabilities of what coding can do, even creating an interactive 3D animation.</p>    
        
    <h4>12. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h4>
        <p>The interaction gets boring fast.<br>
            The website urges the users to try other experiences that they provide. It would be better if the users can change the background picture of the interaction, which may result in a variation of colours instead of the constant silver, gray, and white.</p>
        
    <h4>13. What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h4>
        <p> I think the reset button is the most satisfying feature of the interaction. Because as I play around with the settings, things are bound to be messy as the 3D liquid animation will eventually cover the screen with wavy after effects, then with just a press of the reset button, everything resets and returns to normal.</p>
